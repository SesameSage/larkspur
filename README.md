A MUD (classic multiplayer text-based RPG) focused on detailed combat strategy and party formation, made friendly for first-time MUD players.

Takes inspiration from modern graphic RPGs like Divinity: Original Sin, Dragon Age, The Elder Scrolls, Path of Exile, etc. Built with Evennia.

Combat is turn-based and lies on a spatial grid, incorporating both melee and ranged interactions, and including effects on tiles from spells. 

10 diverse classes with choice-based ability trees and perks, to balance your team and replay any time with a completely different playstyle. Story choices matter!

Roleplay is NOT mandatory - be casual when you want to be!
